# dividedparty.github.io
The idea is, working for self-determination (SD) of all groups, who want SD, for all to unite here on Github. Divided Party (DiP),
a new political party in South Africa, represents self-determination for all South Africans, who want SD. Probably, DiP is the only
political party outside of Switzerland, 
promoting the policy to arrange self-determination for those on the left and the right in one party. Due to the international nature
of politics of the 21st century, this webpage was formed, giving the opportunity to all who agree with DiP, to unite with DiP, and
develop the website further. Raising funds for self-determination politics, is particularly problematic, therefore a new cryptocurrency
funding model is used, others can also use, by listing brand tokens on Ipparts Exchange (IPPAEX). New movements and political parties,
which also promote self-determination for all, are invited to build on this website.
